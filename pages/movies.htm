            <h5 class="center">The New Bauhaus</h5>
            <i>Monday, October 5</i>
            <p>As the Nazis took over Germany, many 
            of the displaced Bauhaus masters found refuge in the United States. In 1937, 
            László Moholy-Nagy came to Chicago to start the New Bauhaus. The school was 
            far from successful initially, but through its various incarnations, 
            Moholy-Nagy and his New Bauhaus forever transformed design, photography and 
            arts education in America and beyond. In Chicago, The New Bauhaus evolved 
            from its origins at the German Bauhaus into an extraordinary flowering of 
            interdisciplinary design pedagogy premised on the notion that “the whole 
            field of contemporary architecture and design must be based upon an 
            indivisible unification of formerly separated and independent fields.” 
            Featuring Producer Alyssa Nahmias by phone for Q&amp;A after the movie.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Frey Part II: The Architectural Interpreter</h5>
            <i>Monday, November 2</i>
            <p>In a follow up to last year's Frey I, Frey II starts in 1939. Swiss-born Corbusian architectural envoy 
            <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/frey.htm">Albert Frey</a>
            embarks on a decades-long journey of discovery. His world travels and love of nature 
            would lead him to carve out a new style of modernism, leaving its indelible 
            mark on the desert community of Palm Springs, California. With 
            never-before-seen archival films, photographs and interviews, this 
            film continues to reveal the mystique of an influential architectural master. Plus 
            it has spectacular footage of Frey's work in Palm Springs. Featuring producer Jake Gorst by 
            phone for Q&amp;A after the movie.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Goff</h5>
            <i>Monday, January 11</i>
            <p>American architect 
            <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/goff.htm">Bruce Goff</a>
            tried to go beyond infinity throughout his career, 
            exploring the possibilities of architecture from an unconventional point of 
            view, using common materials in innovative ways and coming up with 
            futuristic combinations of colours and textures. During a long teaching 
            career, Goff also developed projects for private clients, among them 
            Ledbetter House (1947), Bachman House (1948), and Bavinger House (1950). 
            Goff’s willingness to explore unprecedented forms, his passion for new 
            materials, shapes and solutions, meant that his work wasn't often received 
            in a favourable light from more conservative environments. Featuring Producer Britni Harris 
            for Q&amp;A by phone after the movie.</p>

            <i>Monday, February 1</i>
            <p>This documentary tells the story of Sydney Opera House architect Jørn Utzon's unique gift, brought to the world with the unending support of Lis, 
            the love of his life. His story is told by the people who were closest to him: his children, close colleagues and friends, who share their open, 
            honest anecdotes and experiences of him as an architect and a man. The film is a portrait of a devoted humanitarian and a sensitive and loving soul. Featuring 
            producer Lene Borch Hansen for Q&amp;A by phone after the movie.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Leisurama</h5>
            <i>Monday, March 1</i>
            <p>Leisurama is a 
            compelling documentary about architecture and design. Leisurama concept was 
            born out of a model home, with interiors by Raymond Loewy, shown at the 
            American National Exhibit in Moscow in 1959 — site of the famous "kitchen 
            debate" between Krushchev and Nixon. The model house shown there was an 
            incipient Cold War symbol, a testament of the quality of life enjoyed by the 
            average American. A developer subsequently had the idea to build an 
            entire colony of affordable vacation homes on Montauk, designed by Andrew 
            Geller, who designed banks and stores for Loewy but on his own gained 
            acclaim for his fantastic, angular beach houses. As Geller describes in the 
            film, he gave the developer many different ideas for the home designs of 
            what would become the "Leisurama" community, but they went with essentially 
            the one most similar to existing suburban "ranchburgers," as Alastair Gordon 
            puts it. Featuring Producer Jake Gorst 
            by phone for Q&amp;A after the movie.</p>

            <h5 class="center">The Human Shelter</h5>
            <i>Monday, April 5</i>
            <p>How do we construct homes in 
            today’s worldwide hotspots which are facing the challenges of climate 
            change, globalization and migration? How do people create shelters and feel 
            at home with others and in their bodies?&nbsp; ​Boris Benjamin Bertram’s 
            film The Human Shelter, explores different people’s ways of creating their 
            homes around the globe. In a refugee camp outside Mosul, in a shanty town on 
            the lagoon in Lagos, or in six square metres in the megacity of Tokyo.&nbsp; 
            The exploring director also visits the Sami reindeer herders in the arctic 
            circle, and NASA’s futuristic Mars habitat in Hawaii, USA. It’s a poetic 
            expedition around four continents. An existential film about how we 
            construct and articulate stories about our homes.</p>
