    </a>
    <p>"The Cherry/Gordon house is an example of modern architecture trying hard, very hard, to be on its best manners&mdash;in essence, to be a good neighbor. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how Cherry could have designed a house that fit in better than the one that now stands half-finished on Euclid Street, unless he were prepared to throw in the towel and produce a make-believe Victorian." -- Paul Goldberger, Vanity Fair</p>

    <p>
        The 2100-square-foot house was designed in 2013 by owner/architect 
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/cherry.htm">Louis Cherry</a>. 
        Because the house is in the Oakwood Historic District, Cherry received the mandated Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) building approval September 9, 2013 from the Raleigh Historic Development Commission (RHDC) after 
        <a href="Cherry-EuclidCOA.pdf">fully complying</a> 
        with the RHDC&rsquo;s requirements.Cherry started construction on October 24.
    </p>

    <p>
        On October 1, neighbor 
        <a href="https://www.zillow.com/profile/House-Lady/" target="_self">Gail Wiesner</a> 
        (515 Euclid, across the street) went before the City Council to complain about the RHDC ruling. The Council listened politely. Then Wiesner and her attorney, 
        <a href="https://www.peteschlaw.com/Attorney.aspx" target="_self"> Andy Petesch</a>, 
        appealed the RHDC ruling to the Board of Adjustment (BOA) on November 17, appearing before them in December 2013. The BOA deferred discussion until January.
    </p>
    
    <p>Note that contrary to published reports, Wiesner filed the appeal AFTER Cherry started construction, not the reverse.</p>

    <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/87935667" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen id="I1" name="I1"></iframe>

    <p>
        Then Wiesner and Petesch presented for three hours at the BOA in 
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/87935667">January 2014</a>. 
        <a href="https://www.midtownraleighnews.com/2014/02/17/3630206/approval-for-modernist-oakwood.html" target="_self">More coverage from the News and Observer</a>. 
        Read the 
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/BOAMinutes20140113.doc">BOA minutes</a> 
        from that meeting.
    </p>

    <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88220735" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen id="I2" name="I2"></iframe>

    <p>
        In February 2014, the  
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/88220735">BOA reversed the RHDC</a>, 
        despite Chair Thomas Coble's reminder of the BOA's specific statutory responsibility to only consider whether due process was followed, not to re-try the RHDC hearing.The unprecedented decision revoked Cherry's construction permits and put all approved RHDC construction projects in jeopardy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Later in February the Raleigh City Council, which has jurisdiction over the BOA, sidestepped the matter entirely; City Attorney 
        Thomas McCormick said he will not appeal the BOA ruling. As reported in 
        <a href="https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/a-contemporary-home-threatens-to-tear-oakwood-apart/Content?oid=3855979" target="_self">The Indy</a>, 
        Cherry is "considering whether to apply for another [COA] or to appeal the Board's decision in court."
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, the state's foremost authority on historic preservation supports Cherry and the integrity of the RHDC process. Preservation North Carolina President Myrick Howard, 
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/2014MyrickHowardCherry.pdf" target="_self">in a February letter to Oakwood residents</a>, 
        said that "the design of the Cherry/Gordon home is in line with a half-century of preservation philosophy and practice, contrary to the assertion of their opponents."
    </p>

    <p>Former NC Department of Transportation Secretary Gene Conti said, "It is a living district and should continue to allow new construction consistent with the RHDC guidelines,&rdquo; Conti wrote to the Raleigh City Council. &ldquo;When a house receives RHDC approval, it should not be reversible just because some residents don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>
        Christopher Roberts, President of the American Institute of Architects / Triangle Chapter 
        <a href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/526ffdb4e4b0c99bd50c5fd6/t/5315fb1de4b02c6fff2d7129/1393949469973/RHDC%20vs%20BOA%20Ruling%20at%20516%20Euclid%20St.pdf">wrote the Mayor and City Council</a> i

    <p>The BOA's reversal  
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/2014-02-BOA-Minutes.doc">became official March 10</a>.
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/BOAMinutesMarch2014.pdf">Here are the minutes</a> 
        from that meeting. 
        <a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/video/13467629/">WRAL reported that night</a>

    </p>

    <p>
        Cherry's attorney 
        <a href="https://www.youngmoorelaw.com/h/our-people/lawyers/nick-fountain/">Nick Fountain</a> 
        said his client's options are to re-apply to the RHDC, file an appeal with the Wake County Superior Court, or both.
    </p>

    <p>On March 11, Preservation North Carolina's Myrick Howard wrote about the issue in the News and Observer.</p>

    <p>
        On March 12, someone (not Cherry or Gordon) 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernOakwood">started a Twitter account</a> 
        speaking as the voice of the "house." The "house" has an email address: 
        <a href="mailto:oakwoodmodernhouse2014@gmail.com">oakwoodmodernhouse2014@gmail.com</a>. 
        This person's identity is as yet unknown. About the same time, someone (not Gail Wiesner) started a 
        Twitter account representing themselves as Gail Wiesner. The latter account has, appropriately, been shut down.

    <p>
        On March 13, Cherry and Gordon 
        <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/2014/03/20/3717705/oakwood-modernist-house-owners.html">wrote</a> 
        to the City Council. 
        <a href="https://www.midtownraleighnews.com/2014/03/13/3698314/construction-to-be-stopped-on.html">Midtown Raleigh News</a> 
        reported: Raleigh City Attorney Dorothy Leapley said the board failed to establish whether Wiesner has the right to challenge Cherry&rsquo;s permits. She said Wiesner would need to offer proof that her property value will be affected &ndash; something that didn&rsquo;t happen during Board of Adjustment hearings. &ldquo;The courts said simply living across the street wasn&rsquo;t good enough in itself,&rdquo; Leapley said. Leapley said Wiesner&rsquo;s role is among several issues the board failed to resolve. The attorney also said the ruling needs to be based on the &ldquo;physical environment&rdquo; of the entire Oakwood neighborhood, not individual streets or homes.

    <p>
        12 former RHDC Chairs (1969-2008) 
        <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/2014RHDCChairs.pdf">
        wrote the Raleigh City Council</a> urging them to appeal the BOA ruling.
    </p>
    
    <p>On March 17, the Editors of the 
 
News and Observer wrote: "The Raleigh City Council has some serious rule-changing to do. Cherry and his wife never should have been put in this position. Should the board&rsquo;s ruling stand, the couple could lose a fortune in having to tear down a perfectly good (and perfectly appropriate) house. They should not have to hire a lawyer to fight this. The city has an obligation to see to it that the Board of Adjustment&rsquo;s ruling is overturned. This was a huge error in judgment. And it must be corrected." Later that day, 
 <a href="https://www.wncn.com/story/25000518/owners-of-modern-oakwood-home-want-city-council-to-intervene">
WNCN reported</a> that Cherry and Gordon urged the City Council to pursue an appeal.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">On March 14, a closed meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Oakwood took place. The long-standing neighborhood preservation group, going back decades, has not taken a public position on the controversy. The meeting was covered by WTVD with comments by Preservation North Carolina's Myrick Howard.</p>
<p>On March 18, the Raleigh City Council discussed the matter in closed session as reported by

	On March 30, the house made the front page of the News and Observer, featuring a video by Colin Campbell.

	 On May 6, blogger Maureen Rogers of Boston 
	 <a href="https://pinkslipblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/there-goes-neighborhood.html">
	spread a little love</a>, as did these bikers above!<br/>
	<br/>On June 28, led by Dave Weisner (husband of Gail), a fundraising BBQ was held in Oakwood to support their case.<br/>
	<br/>
	On July 13, the  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/opinion/sunday/is-an-ugly-house-grounds-to-sue.html">
	New York Times</a> reported on the controversy which magnified the case around the world once again.<br/>
	<br/>
	On August 17, NCModernist held a  
	special LDF fundraising event at a private museum in the historic district of Hillsborough NC.<br/>
	<br/>
	Mike Welton covered the case in two articles in his blog Architects+Artisans plus a subsequent article based on the blog on the 
	 <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/j-michael-welton/nc-judge-hears-arguments_b_5709435.html">
	Huffington Post.</a><br/>
	<br/><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/j-michael-welton/nc-judge-hears-arguments_b_5709435.html"> 
	In August, according to  </a><a href="https://www.wncn.com/story/26509728/modern-oakwood-home-construction-can-continue-judge-rules">
	WNCN</a>, Donald Mutrud said the modern home is why he decided to buy on the same block. "That was one of the deciding factors to pull the trigger on my house," Mutrud said. Mutrud along with supporters believe the house is a good thing for Oakwood. "There is a group of us that wants to make sure that it's known that we think it's compatible with things in this district," Mary Dillon said. "That will add to the richness and diversity of the neighborhood."<br/>
	<br/>
	The case went to Wake County Superior Court over two days in August. NCModernist 
	 
	covered the trial via Twitter. Judge Elaine Bushfan was brought in from Durham to provide impartiality. News coverage came from <a href="https://abc11.com/news/battle-over-oakwood-home-continues-/280642/">WTVD</a>,

	famous</a>.<br/>
	<br/>
	On September 10, City of Raleigh attorney Dorothy Leapley issued 
	 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1293313-20140910-modern-oakwood-memo.html"> 
	this memo</a> to the City. On September 11, 
	 <a href="https://www.wral.com/judge-will-rule-in-favor-of-oakwood-homeowners-modern-design/13973473/"> 
	WRAL</a>,<a href="https://www.architectmagazine.com/historic-preservation/modern-home-in-raleigh-faces-historic-preservation-challenge_o.aspx">Architect Magazine</a>, and 
	 <a href="https://abc11.com/news/judge-rules-in-favor-of-oakwood-homeowners/304771/">
	WTVD</a> all reported an upcoming ruling in favor of the Raleigh/Cherry/Gordon team.  
	  <br/><br/>
	The  <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/CherryGordonRuling.PDF">
	formal ruling</a> was issued September 15. As summarized by the News and Observer, it said:<br/>
	<br/>Wiesner didn&rsquo;t have legal grounds to fight the house, which was initially approved by the Raleigh Historic Development Commission nearly a year ago. Wiesner couldn&rsquo;t prove she would &ldquo;suffer an immediate or threatened injury distinct from the general community." This means she had no legal standing to bring action against Cherry/Gordon. Bushfan also determined that the city&rsquo;s Board of Adjustment overstepped its authority when it yanked approvals for the Modernist house. &ldquo;The Board of Adjustment improperly reweighed the evidence and substituted its own judgment for that of the Raleigh Historic Development Commission,&rdquo; she wrote. The ruling allowed construction to resume on the Cherry/Gordon house.

	<br/>
	In October 2014, the  <a href="https://www.wral.com/neighbors-pitch-in-to-landscape-modern-oakwood-home/14095374/"> 
	neighborhood came together</a> to landscape the Cherry/Gordon front yard in an old-style "yardraising." Gail and David Wiesner 
	 <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/2014WiesnerCOAAppeal.pdf">
	filed</a> to take the case to the NC Court of Appeals. However, the Raleigh Board of Adjustment decided to drop out of the suit.<br/>
	<br/>In November 2014, NCModernist and OCPA joined forces to oppose an unrelatedLandmark de-designation case in Raleigh. And later that month, Cherry and Gordon finally moved in.<br/>
	<br/>
	The NC Court of Appeals heard the case in August 2015. Representing Wiesner, attorney Andy Petesch argued that standing was established simply because Cherry/Gordon's house was "incongruous" with the rest of the neighborhood, thus causing his client "special damages," none of which he could specify.Additional arguments on how the RHDC acted encouraged more questions from the judges about Wiesner's standing, for which Petesch cited the 
	 <a href="https://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/html/ar/CourtAppeals/3_May_2011/Old/10-750-1.pdf" target="_blank"> 
	Sanchez</a> and 
	 <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/nc-supreme-court/1452602.html" target="_blank"> 
	Mangum</a> cases as precedent. Cherry/Gordon's counsel Phillip Harris pointed out these cases actually support Bushfan's ruling, and that speculative arguments or simple differences in architectural tastes are not special damages and do not establish legal standing.<br/>
	<br/>
	In February 2016, the NC Court of Appeals  <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/2016-cherry-gordon.pdf">
	found</a> Wiesner had no legal standing and ruled in favor of Cherry/Gordon.

	<p>In March 2016, <a href="2016-cherry-sc.pdf">Wiesner appealed again</a>, this time to the NC Supreme Court, 
	which declined to rule on the case in August of 2016. The matter 
    appeared to be closed.</p>
    
	<p>On February 7, 2017, Gail Wiesner, her husband 
	Dave, Don Baucom, Paula Huot, and Matthew Brown appeared before the 
	Raleigh City Council concerning final approval of Developmental Guidelines 
	for all Raleigh Historic Districts (not just Oakwood). 
	Discussions on these guidelines have been going on nearly ten years with 
	countless public hearings and RHDC meetings. It was to have been summarily 
	approved at this Council meeting. However, the Oakwood group put forward a 
	last-minute revision to eliminate any Modernist houses or even renovations 
    in ANY Raleigh Historic district, as follows:</p>
    
	<img height="116" src="2017-oakwood-gang-rhdc.png" width="600" />
    
    <p>The City Council voted to approve the Guidelines without this language.</p>
